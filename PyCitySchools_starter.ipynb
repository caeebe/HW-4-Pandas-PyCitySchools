    "* An additional metric was calculated, that checks how many students have not just passed on average but who have passed both their reading and their math scores.  This ensures that we are counting the students that may have only passed reading OR math as not passing.  I have included this metric on the far right of the tables as \"% Passing Both\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* The size of the school appears to a very important metric determining the success of the students.  The change in student success happens at schools between 2000-3000 students.  In small schools, more than 90% of the students are passing both math and reading, but a midsize school has significantly lower reading and math scores.  Meanwhile, both Large and Extra Large schools are performing equally poorly with approximately 80% of students passing reading and only 66% of students passing math! However, an extra small school does not seem to correspond to a continued increase in scores.  They perform equally with the standard small schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Surprisingly, increasing School Budget per student does not result in higher test scores or increased passing rates.  The 6 schools with lowest budget have the highest average test scores and passing rates.  Is this because larger schools are somehow more expensive to operate?\n",
    "\n",
    "* All of the top performing schools are Charter Schools and the bottom performing schools are all District Schools. \n",
